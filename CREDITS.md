#Acknowledgements#

RepoTheWeb takes advantage of several great resources out on the web, and the people listed here should take pride in having contributed to what we believe is the next leap in the Web, website integration. 

They're listed here in case their sites go down before us, which we hope wouldn't happen. The URLs these resources originated are documented inline. 

##Icon Artists##

- [Yummy Gum](http://yummygum.com/) (Leon Ephraim & Vince Swiddler) -- config favicon (/www/repotheweb.org/config.ico).
- [Picol](http://www.picol.org/) (Melih Bilgil & Co.) -- select service favicon (/www/repotheweb.org/select.ico).
- "austintheheller" (site's down already) -- [no favicon icon](http://www.veryicon.com/icons/system/august/) (/www/repotheweb.org/select.ico).
- [GentleFace.com](http://gentleface.com/) (no About Us) -- bookmark favicon (/www/repotheweb.org/bookmark.ico)

Yummy Gum, Picol, and GentleFace.com all distribute on findicons.com, so it deserves to get mentioned. 

##Libraries##

- [John Resig](http://ejohn.org/) -- jQuery and micro-templating (embedded in /www/repotheweb.org/utils.js)
- [Toby Ho](http://tobyho.com/) -- OnReady.js (/src/onready.js)
- [James Burke](http://tagneto.blogspot.co.nz/) -- Require.js (lib/r.js) and Almond (lib/almond.js)

##Hackers##

Last, but not least, are the people who brought these together:

- Austin King "ozten" -- Project Manager
- Adrian Cochrane "alcinnz" -- Major initial work

I, Adrian Cochrane, have been helped after getting this to work, on getting it to work well. RepoTheWeb will be a much nicer project after their help.

- Byron Cochrane

	1. For his proper initial UI discussion with me, and those that'll follow. 
	2. For looking over the map schema as a GIS programmer so it can be more than a demo. 

- Nick Sussmilch

	1. For encouraging me to think about colour more on the selection screen.
	2. For his in progress work of compiling sample content for the later mockups, and his excitement at all the possibilities.
