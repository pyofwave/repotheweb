#Maps Demo#

This demo is designed to show fuller capabilities of RepoTheWeb, by showing a (almost) fully functioning "map" schema. Hey, what's a better demo than the software that popularized both centralized widgets/data and Ajax?

##Overview##

This demo displays Google and OSM (somebody else can add Bing) offering to render maps on totally disconnected page (at this point, I'm undecided as to what that page is). 

The map schema portrayed here is more than a simple demo, but a suggestion for a new schema I plan to offer to OSM to develop. 

##Running the demo##

It's unimplemented at the moment.
